      <h2>All About Tarot</h2>
      <p><img src="tarotcard.jpg" alt="tarot" width="400" height="600" id="card"/>Tarot cards are phenominal. Once in history, they were merely card game played for fun. Nowadays, they are correlated to things like the occult. It is believed that they can help predict your future- at least, with the right intuation. Each birth date has a birth card  in tarot. Some people meditate with tarot cards. Tarot card readings provide people a foundation to help guide their choices or see if they are going in the right direction in their lives. While we all have our free will to change the readings, those who participate in tarot find reassurance or warnings in what they get in a reading. Cards can be interpreted in many ways and do not always  have a single set meaning. Various decks have different designs and focuses, leaving spirtuality  to power them and those who read them. This means they are <span class="magic">mystical and magical</span> to all those who believe.</p>
